Submission for George Neal, gln276

Included is the RUN.jar executable java file, and my source code in a
  direcory whose contents are formatted to that of an eclipse project. 

Further Down are parts 1 and 2 (pseudo code and time complexity, and proof of correctness).



From here, the Java source code files can be reached in the directory

EE360Cprog1/src/assignment1



Example executable call 

java -jar RUN.jar input.in

The executable will generate output in the Console. 



Compilation: 
I include the eclipse formatted directory because that is how I know to compile the code and create the executable. If the source is imported into an the eclipse IDE, one can compile the code and export an executable as follows: 

1. Right click the project in the package explorer pane 
   Click "Export" from the context menu
2. Select Java/Runnable JAR file 
   Click Next>
3. From the Launch Configuration drop down, Select Prog2Driver - EE360Cprog2
   Designate the Export destination, and include the executable name at
   the end of the directory path.
   Under Library handling, select Extract required libraries into geerated JAR 
   Do not save as ANT script
   Click Finish

NOTE: Prog2Driver.java contains the main method

The executable should now be in the designated directory from step 3.
